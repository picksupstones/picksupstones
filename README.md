- 👋 Hi, I’m @picksupstones
- 👀 I’m interested in ...I am a new user of QGIS and trying to geo-reference maps on georeferencer.  It takes hours for the raster image
- to show up in georeferencer, and many times it is only a fraction of the pixels.  I need to see the clear image to pick points to Ground Reference my raster image 
- to a base map like open street maps.  I have queried the internet for this problem and cant find a fix there. 
- I tried loading OSM Downloader plugin and it was only suggestion I found, it did not help.  What can be done?   Does everyone using QGIS and loading a
- raster image have to deal with problem?
